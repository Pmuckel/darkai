Installation Theme (Sublime Text 2)
-----------------------------------
Just put the Darkai.sublime-theme and the darkai-directory into a folder (e.g. "Theme - Darkai") inside your packages-folder (so you end up with "/Packages/Theme - Darkai/darkai.sublime-theme" and "/Packages/Theme - Darkai/Darkai/"). After that, add the following line to your user-specific configuration:
```
"theme": "Darkai.sublime-theme"
```

Highlight colors
----------------
Depending on which color you would like to use, add the corresponding line to your user-specific configuration:
```
"theme_color_blue": true
```
```
"theme_color_cyan": true
```
```
"theme_color_green": true
```
```
"theme_color_lilac": true
```
```
"theme_color_magenta": true
```
```
"theme_color_orange": true
```
```
"theme_color_red": true
```
```
"theme_color_yellow": true
```
The default highlight color is an almost-white light gray.
